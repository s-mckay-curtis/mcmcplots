Changes to mcmcplots version 0.4
* convert.mcmc.list
  - added this function to help convert objects to mcmc.list objects.
* denplot, denoverplot1:
  - corrected a bug that would not recognize the "lwd" option when style="gray". (Thanks to Pei-Hsuan Chiu.)
  - added option "ci" to plot credible intervals.
* caterplot:
  - added the eps option which controls the spacing between chains (or density strips) when collapse=FALSE.
  - added the las option which controls the rotation of the parameter labels on the label axis. (Thanks to Jessi Brown for the idea.)
* mcmcplot, mcmcplot1, denoverplot1
  - added xlim and ylim options. (Thanks to Ilya Goldin for the idea.)
* denplot, corplot, denoverplot, traplot, caterplot
  - added the greek option which attemts to convert the names of greek letters in labels to greek characters on the plot.
* denoverplot
  - corrected bug that plotted a gray background for the legend when style="plain"
  - added option "ci" to plot credible intervals.
* traplot, denoverplot
  - added plot.title option and changed the functionality of the main option to match denplot
* mcmcplotsPalette
  - added option "type" which selects the type of color palette to create: rainbow, sequential, or grayscale. (Thanks to Ilya Goldin for the idea.)
  - deprecated "seq" option
* caterplot, mcmcplot, denplot, traplot
  - These functions now assign variable names (with a warning) when the mcmcout argument does not have valid variable names.
* parms2plot
  - simplified function logic (at least, that was my intent... maybe I just made things more complicated)
  - added "leaf.marker" option
  - added "do.unlist" option to allow for hyperlinking to parameter groups in the mcmcplot plot function. (Thanks to Ilya Goldin for writing some initial code.)
* mcmcplot
  - added hyperlinking to parameter groups, improved layout of plots with CSS file, removed dependence on R2HTML.
* .html.begin, .html.end, .html.img
  - new functions contributed by Ilya Goldin for use by mcmcplot.


Changes to mcmcplots version 0.3
* autplot1:
  - now plots confidence intervals
  - corrected broken compatibility with as.ts.mcmc in the coda package.  (Thanks to Martyn Plummer for supplying a patch)
* caterplot: added new arguments
  - denstrip: plots density strips instead of quantile lines
  - width: width of the density strips
  - add: add to the existing plot instead of creating a new plot


Changes to mcmcplots version 0.2
* graypr: coloring and weights of gridlines modified slightly
* autplot1: default coloring changed from black to mcmcplotsPalette(1)
* mcmcplotsPalette: added arguemnt 'seq' to allow for corplot to use sequential_hcl as the default colors.
* corplot: changed the default colors (see above)
* mcmcplotsPalette: changed the default chroma value to be brighter (old=75 to new=100)
* caterplot: argument 'horizontal' added to allow horizontal or vertical plotting of intervals.
* caterpoints: argument 'horizontal' added to match caterpoints.
* corplot: adds a legend by default
* denplot: added 'plot.title' argument and 'main' argument for labeling of the whole plot and labeling of individual plots
* corplot: added argument 'legend.scale' to allow user control over the size of the legend relative to the size of the rest of the plot
* mcmcplot1: changed formatting of plot
* autplot1: added 'partial' argument for the plotting of partial autocorrelation
* caterplot: changed 'labels' argument to 'labels.loc' and let 'labels' argument be a character string of labels
